                                The scope of a variable means where it can be accessed within a program. Variables
                                declared with the var keyword have either global or functional scope. It depends on
                                where they are declared. Variables declared with var outside of any function blocks have
                                global scope, meaning they can be accessed from anywhere within the program. Variables
                                declared with var within a function block have functional scope, meaning they can only
                                be accessed from within that function block.

                                Variables declared with the let and const keywords have block scope, which means they
                                can only be accessed from within the block in which they are declared. This includes
                                nested blocks, so a variable declared within an if statement block cannot be accessed
                                from outside of that block.

                                Null and undefined both means there is no value for a variable. But null and undefined
                                are used for different purposes. Null is used to explicitly represent the absence of a
                                value in a variable, while undefined is used to indicate that a variable has been
                                declared but not yet assigned a value.

                                When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it takes on the value of
                                undefined. On the other hand, null is an intentional absence of value. It is used to
                                indicate that a variable is intentionally not holding any value.

                                REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface.
                                It is an architectural style for designing APIs that are based on HTTP. REST APIs are
                                used to expose data and functionality of a server to other applications. It is a way for
                                two applications to communicate with each other using HTTP requests and responses.
